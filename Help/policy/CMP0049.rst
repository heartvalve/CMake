Do not expand variables in target source entries.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower expanded variables which were escaped in CMake code to
bypass initial expansion by the CMake language:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(sources foo.c)
  add_executable(foo \${sources})

This was undocumented behavior.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to expand such variables when processing
the target sources.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue an error
if such variables need to be expanded.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or
NEW explicitly.
